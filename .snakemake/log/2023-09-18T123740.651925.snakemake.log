Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './split_files' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 8
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule cdhit_clustering in file /home/labgen/github/DeTox/snakefile, line 49:
Job 6  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
basename.clustered
Removing output files of failed job cdhit_clustering since they might be corrupted:
basename.clustered.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
