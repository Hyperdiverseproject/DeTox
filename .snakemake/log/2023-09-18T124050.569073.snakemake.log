Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './split_files' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 8
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Removing output files of failed job blast_on_contaminants since they might be corrupted:
basename.blastsnuc.out
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
